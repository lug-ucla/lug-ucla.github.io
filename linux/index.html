Many of these programs are Open Source and/or free.</p><h2 id=getting-linux>Getting Linux</h2><p>Interested in trying out Linux?

Most of the Debian ones just work straight out of the box. There&rsquo;s also tons of support.</p><p>If you have some experience (or you&rsquo;re a beginner who is fine with using the terminal), you can try one of the Arch-based distributions. Installing Arch takes a while, but it&rsquo;s actually not too hard. If you&rsquo;re too lazy to install Arch, choose a distribution with a graphical installer (like EndeavourOS).</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a quiz you can try: <a href=https://distrochooser.de/en/>https://distrochooser.de/en/</a></p><h2 id=comparing-arch-and-debian>Comparing Arch and Debian</h2><p>Choose Arch-based distributions if you want a minimal distribution. Choose Debian based distributions if you want stability or ease of use.</p><h1 id=desktop-environment>Desktop Environment</h1><p>The <strong>desktop environment</strong> (DE) is what makes up most of the user interface. It may include system panels, docks, window borders, backgrounds, and desktop widgets, among other things. GNU/Linux has a wide variety of DEs avaliable‚Äîthis page will outline some of the most popular ones.</p><p>It is important to note that no DE is tied to a particular GNU/Linux distribution, or vice versa. Thus, if your distribution of choice is Debian, you may use GNOME, or KDE, or both GNOME and KDE (if you installed both). You can install as many different DEs as you want and try them all!</p><p>The three main desktop environments are XFCE, KDE, and GNOME.</p><p><strong>XFCE:</strong></p><p>XFCE is designed to be fast and minimalist</p><p><strong>GNOME:</strong></p><p>GNOME is simpler to use, and looks nicer. Of course, this comes at the cost of performance (the difference isn&rsquo;t that much though).</p><p><strong>KDE:</strong></p><p>KDE is in between GNOME and XFCE in terms of performance and features. If you are unsure, KDE is a good choice.</p><h3 id=tiling-windows-managers>Tiling windows managers:</h3><p>Tiling window managers are a lot more difficult to use, and aren&rsquo;t for beginners. Navigation is usually done using the keyboard as opposed to the mouse.</p><h2 id=foss-software>FOSS Software</h2><p>Below is an overview of some popular software for Linux. For more software and downloads, check out our Software Downloads section.</p><h3 id=web-browser---firefox-chromium>Web Browser - Firefox, Chromium</h3><p>Firefox is a standards-compliant open source web browser developed by the free software community with the cooperation and support of Mozilla Corporation. Firefox provides all essential features of a browser for the modern web, and also a wide variety of add-ons that will undoubtedly satisfy anybody&rsquo;s needs and wants.</p><p>Chromium is the open source web browser project from which Google Chrome draws its source code.</p><h3 id=office-suite---libreoffice>Office Suite - LibreOffice</h3><p>LibreOffice is a free and open source office suite. It includes key office applications such as a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation manager, and drawing program, all with a user interface and feature set similar to other office suites.</p><p>Sophisticated and flexible, LibreOffice also works transparently with a variety of file formats, including those of Microsoft Office. It primarily supports the Open Document Formats (ODF), such as .odt (documents), .ods (spreadsheets), and .odp (presentations). Here at the LUG, these are the formats we primarily use. Also, many European governments are adopting ODF as the official format for electronic documents. ODF and LibreOffice promotes total interoperability and information integrity.</p><h3 id=instant-messaging---pidgin-empathy>Instant Messaging - Pidgin, Empathy</h3><p>Pidgin is a messaging program that supports multiple protocols, including XMPP/Jabber (e.g. Google Talk), IRC, MSN, AIM, ICQ, amd Yahoo!. It features many plugins and has a large community surrounding it.</p><p>Empathy is a messaging program that supports XMPP/Jabber (e.g. Google Talk), SIP, IRC, MSN, AIM, ICQ, and Yahoo!. It supports voice and video calls (only for XMPP and SIP), and has excellent integration with the GNOME desktop.</p><h3 id=audio-player---vlc-mplayer-clementine>Audio Player - VLC, MPlayer, Clementine</h3><p>VLC is famously known as the player that &ldquo;plays everything.&rdquo; It can handle DVDs, (S)VCDs, Audio CDs, web streams, TV cards and much more. You don&rsquo;t need to keep track of a dozen codec packs you need to have installed. VLC has nearly all codecs built-in. It can even play the file or media if it is damaged!</p><ul><li>Comparison of audio player software - Wikipedia</li></ul><h3 id=movie-player---mplayer-vlc>Movie Player - MPlayer, VLC</h3><p>MPlayer is a movie player for Linux.

You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, FLI, and even DivX movies too.</p><p>Another big feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. MPlayer supports displaying through a number of hardware MPEG decoder boards such as the DVB and DXR3/Hollywood+ . And what about nice, big anti-aliased shaded subtitles (9 supported types!!!) with european/ISO 8859-1,2 (hungarian, english, czech, etc), cyrillic, korean fonts, and OSD.</p><h3 id=graphics-software---gimp-inkscape>Graphics Software - GIMP, Inkscape</h3><p>GIMP is a professional <em>raster</em> image manipulation program, and part of the GNU project. It is suitable for tasks such as photo retouching, image composition, image authoring, or any other task that requires manipulation of raster images.</p><p>Inkscape is a professional <em>vector</em> image manipulation/creation program.</p><h3 id=programming---gcc-eclipse-qt>Programming - Gcc, Eclipse, Qt</h3><p>The GNU Compiler Collection contains frontends for C, C++, Objective C, Chill, Fortran, and Java, as well as libraries for these languages. It is a full-featured ANSI C compiler, with support for K&R C as well.</p><p>GCC provides many levels of source code error checking traditionally provided by other tools (such as lint), produces debugging information, and can perform many different optimizations to the resulting object code.</p><h3 id=games>Games</h3><p>A quick list of popular games that have been ported to Linux:</p><ul><li>Civilization: Call to Power</li><li>Counter Strike</li><li>Counter Strike: Source</li><li>Descent 3</li><li>Doom 1/2/3</li><li>Half Life</li><li>Half Life: Source</li><li>Half Life 2 , HL2: E1, HL2: E2</li><li>Homeworld</li><li>Kerbal Space Program</li><li>Never Winter Nights</li><li>Postal 2</li><li>Quake 1/2/3 (see ioquake3-based projects, such as OpenArena)</li><li>Sid Meier&rsquo;s Alpha Centauri</li><li>Simcity 3000 Unlimited</li><li>Soldier Of Fortune</li><li>Team Fortress 2</li><li>Tribes 2</li><li>Unreal Tournament</li></ul><p>Here are some fun open source games:</p><ul><li>SuperTux</li><li>SuperTuxKart</li><li>Xonotic</li></ul></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>¬© 2022 Copyright | <a href=https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil>Ezhil theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
