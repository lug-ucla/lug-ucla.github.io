## Article 1. Name

This organization shall be referred to as the Linux Users Group at the  University of California, Los Angeles (LUG@UCLA). The University of  California, Los Angeles will hereafter in this document be referred to  as "UCLA," or "the University."

## Article 2. Statement of Purpose

Linux is both a powerful, freely-available computer operating system and a  fascinating sociological event with few parallels, the product of an  international programmer community that exists independently of any  national boundaries.

The LUG@UCLA's purpose is to facilitate learning, creativity, and the advancement of computer science. To accomplish this goal, LUG@UCLA  promotes the use of the Linux operating system at UCLA by encouraging  its use among students, faculty, staff, and University departments; by  providing a support network for Linux users; and by building a library  of Linux- related materials.

In attempting to promote the use of Linux, we also encourage  programming under this operating system in the form of  student-coordinated projects. LUG@UCLA student projects must benefit the UCLA community, the Linux community, or any subsets of the two. All  software produced under the auspices of LUG@UCLA shall be distributed  under the GNU General Public License, or the GNU Lesser General Public  License, as appropriate.

The group will have any number of projects being worked on at a  given time, each with its own methods of organization and  responsibility. The sole limitation on such projects is that they fall  within the rules and focus of LUG@UCLA.

## Article 3. Membership

### Section 1. General Membership

LUG@UCLA grants membership to anyone who asks for it. There shall be no membership fee or interviews.

### Section 2. Policy of Non-discrimination

LUG@UCLA, in accordance with applicable Federal and State law and University  Policy, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national  origin, religion, sex, disability, age, medical condition, ancestry,  marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or status as a veteran  of the Armed Forces.

LUG@UCLA also prohibits sexual harassment. This  non-discrimination policy covers organization membership, access to  organization programs and activities, and the general treatment of  members in the organization.

## Article 4. Offices and Elections

LUG@UCLA shall operate on a collaborative style of leadership, employing one  President, three Vice-Presidents, and one Treasurer. LUG@UCLA shall  elect officers once per academic year or as necessary. Only members  currently enrolled as UCLA undergraduate and graduate students are  eligible to hold office. All members of the group are allowed to vote in elections of the LUG@UCLA.

We will use the approval voting system. Voters select which  candidates they approve of (they can select multiple), and the candidate with the most approvals wins.

Ties will be broken by a game of SuperTuxKart.
