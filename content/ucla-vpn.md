The UCLA VPN allows you to access campus resources even when you are  away from campus. This is useful for downloading scientific journals,  for example. 

Connecting to the UCLA VPN is easy.  

Open NetworkManager and add a Cisco AnyConnect VPN connection. 

Set the gateway to **ssl.vpn.ucla.edu**. The username/password are the same as your school login. Please note that you will need to  have your phone ready to do the two-factor authentication.
