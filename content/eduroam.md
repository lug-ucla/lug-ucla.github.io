Connecting to the eduroam WiFi network (on the UCLA campus) is easy  with Linux. eduroam is available almost everywhere on campus, so this is probably the most convenient WiFi network.

## Using NetworkManager

Connect to the *eduroam* network using the following Wireless Security settings:

| Security             | WPA & WPA2 Enterprise |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Authentication       | Protected EAP (PEAP)  |
| PEAP version         | Automatic             |
| Inner authentication | MSCHAPv2              |
| Username             | your UCLA username    |
| Password             | your UCLA password    |

For other networks (like UCLA_SECURE_RES), going to the following website: http://nmcheck.gnome.org/ should bring up the "Accept terms and conditions" page.
