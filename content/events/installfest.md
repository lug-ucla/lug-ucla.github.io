## General Info

LUG hosts a quarterly installfest on Friday of 2nd week. Attendees will be provided a USB drive and guide to dual booting their computers with Linux (most likely Debian or Arch Linux). However, attendees are welcome to bring their own flash drives and install any distro of their choice as well. Or if attendants do not feel comfortable with the possibility of losing their data, they can set up a Virtual Machine instead.

## Note on M1 and M2 Macs

We will not be able to install Linux on M1 and M2 Macs since they use custom Apple cores, however you can still set up a Virtual Machine to run Linux so feel free to come and chat with us! We plan on hosting a seperate event later about installing Asahi Linux, an Arch clone that works on M1 and M2 Macs.
