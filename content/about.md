If you want help installing Linux or just want to eat  and hang out, come to installfest!  The [LUG Lounge](https://linux.ucla.edu/wiki/index.php/Lounge),  at **Boelter Hall 2763**, is a meeting/study/hangout  place for the group and facilitates a lot its activities. Feel free  to stop by and meet other Linux users (as well as people in ACM and UPE)!   


There is a makerspace on the floor below us, where you can go and 3D print things (as well as lasercut them). 

There is also a trash heap outside the first floor (next to the  Engineering IV building), where you can sometimes find old  monitors/computers and old networking equipment.
