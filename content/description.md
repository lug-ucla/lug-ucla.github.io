The LUG has been a group at UCLA for over 17 years, during which  time it has helped expose free software to many people.

**Please explain the benefit students may derive from your  organization. Include how your group stimulates discussion, benefits  education, or provides enrichment of any kind.**

The LUG maintains a Linux computer lab and servers that host  various digital services, which people can use to help familiarize  themselves with Linux and other standardized technologies. The LUG is a  constant source of Linux assistance to anybody that is in need. The LUG  holds talks and presentations introducing various topics in computer  science. Sometimes, group members engage in conversations surrounding  the politics and economics of Linux.

**Please describe the goals of your organization.**

The goals of the LUG at UCLA parallels the goals of the thousands of other LUGs around the globe: to provide support and/or education for Linux users, both inexperienced and experienced.
